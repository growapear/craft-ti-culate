# craft-ti-culate
A digital space where craft gestures live, evolve, and connect generations.

A living archive of hand gestures â€” a place where craft moves beyond static images into dynamic memory. By capturing, tracing, and transforming the subtle movements of making, Crafticulate turns embodied knowledge into a shared digital language. Each interaction becomes a bridge: connecting artisans across time, reimagining traditions through the hands of today and tomorrow.
